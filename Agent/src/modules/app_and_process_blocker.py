# WORKFLOW
# Program launch

# Python script starts execution.

# The current process ID (SELF_PID) is captured so the program does not kill itself.

# Administrator privilege verification

# Windows API IsUserAnAdmin() is called.

# If the program is NOT running as Administrator:

# Execution stops immediately.

# No monitoring or killing logic runs.

# If Administrator:

# Program continues.

# Configuration load

# A fixed in-memory set of blocked executable names is loaded.

# Names are lowercase and compared case-insensitively.

# Scan interval is defined (example: 0.4 seconds).

# Windows API preparation

# Kernel32.dll is loaded once.

# Required Windows constants are defined.

# PROCESSENTRY32 structure is defined to exactly match the Windows SDK layout.

# Function signatures are declared so ctypes does not guess types.

# This prevents crashes and memory corruption.

# Initial full process scan (critical step)

# CreateToolhelp32Snapshot is called with TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS.

# Windows returns a snapshot of ALL currently running processes.

# This snapshot is static and safe to iterate.

# Snapshot iteration

# Process32First is called to get the first process entry.

# Process32Next is repeatedly called to iterate through all processes.

# For each process:

# Process ID (PID) is read.

# Executable name is extracted from szExeFile.

# Name is decoded, stripped of null bytes, and converted to lowercase.

# Initial termination pass

# Each process name is checked against the blocked list.

# If a match is found:

# OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE) is called.

# If a valid handle is returned:

# TerminateProcess is executed immediately.

# Handle is closed to prevent leaks.

# This step kills all blocked processes that were already running before the script started.

# Initial scan completion

# Snapshot handle is closed.

# At this point:

# No blocked applications should be running.

# Continuous monitoring loop starts

# The script enters an infinite loop.

# This loop is responsible for killing newly launched processes.

# Periodic rescan

# On every loop iteration:

# A new process snapshot is created.

# The full process list is scanned again.

# This is NOT event-based.

# This is intentional for stability and predictability.

# New process detection (implicit)

# Any process that appears in the snapshot:

# Is evaluated immediately.

# There is no need to track “new vs old” explicitly.

# If a blocked process exists at scan time:

# It is killed, regardless of when it started.

# Repeated enforcement

# If a blocked application restarts itself:

# It will be killed again in the next scan cycle.

# If a user launches a blocked app manually:

# It will live only until the next scan (usually < 0.5s).

# CPU efficiency behavior

# Toolhelp snapshots are lightweight.

# The script sleeps between scans.

# CPU usage remains low and stable.

# No busy-waiting occurs.

# Error containment

# If a process exits between snapshot and termination:

# OpenProcess fails silently.

# Script continues without crashing.

# If access is denied:

# Process is skipped.

# Next scan may still catch it.

# Long-running stability

# No COM objects are used.

# No WMI queries are used.

# No callbacks or blocking API calls exist.

# Script can run for hours or days without degradation.

# Exit conditions

# Script runs indefinitely.

# It only stops if:

# Manually terminated

# System shuts down

# Python process crashes (unlikely with this design)
