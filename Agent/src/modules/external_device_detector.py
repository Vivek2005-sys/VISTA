# 🧠 Flow of Execution

# ctypes sets up WinAPI access
# Python gains the ability to read raw Windows event data.

# You define the Windows device header struct
# This matches what Windows sends when a device changes.

# You create a window callback (wnd_proc)
# Windows will call this function when something happens.

# You register a hidden window class
# This tells Windows which function to notify.

# You create an invisible window
# Required — Windows only sends device events to windows.

# You enter the message loop (PumpMessages)
# Your script goes idle and waits. No polling, no CPU waste.

# USB is plugged in or removed
# Windows sends WM_DEVICECHANGE to your window.

# wnd_proc is called by Windows
# ctypes reads the raw event data.

# State is updated

# Insert → connected = True

# Remove → connected = False
